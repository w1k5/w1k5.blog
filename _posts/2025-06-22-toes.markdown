I love to wiggle my toes.<br /> 
With morning coffee, warmth flows—<br /> 
from the tips of my ears<br /> 
to the ends of my feet.

When feelings rise like ocean swells,<br /> 
I ride them out in quiet spells.<br /> 
I ground myself from heel to sole—<br /> 
a small but sacred, steady goal.<br /> 
I feel the floor beneath my feet,<br /> 
its solid whisper, calm and sweet.

This is why I love my toes.<br /> 
They’re dainty things, in tidy rows.

They’re further than my hands, by far,<br /> 
but closer than reflections are.<br /> 
The mirror shows a distant face,<br /> 
and my toes are proof I still have place.

I love them when he pulls them near,<br /> 
with kisses soft, without a fear.<br /> 
I love them when they hold me fast,<br /> 
through heavy days or shadows cast.

They hold me up—<br /> 
no need for show.<br /> 
I love my toes.<br /> 
They always know.

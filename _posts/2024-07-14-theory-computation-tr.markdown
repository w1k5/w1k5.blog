Tomb Raider, a late-90s video game featuring the iconic character Lara Croft, presents players with the adventurous pursuits of an athletic British archaeologist navigating treacherous environments with mortal health and breath. Having been reimagined and remastered a total of three times, the gameplay has always encompassed exploration, platforming, combat, and puzzle-solving.
